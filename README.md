# SQLHandler-php
PHP version of SQLHandler, a [database manager](https://github.com/nothing4free/SQLHandler) I made for an university project. My friends Pedro Ventura, Henri Banyuls and I designed the database, and I created this manager. This program works with the SQL database provided in the "database" directory. </br>

The PHP code was based on the [W3Schools PHP-MySQL connector documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_mysql_connect.asp), and it was adapted to work within a very basic web application.
